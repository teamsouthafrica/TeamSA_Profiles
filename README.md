# TeamSA_Profiles

These profiles need to be loaded using the Questing bot.
Ensure that you are using a legitimate version of Honorbuddy at all times.
No support will be provided for users who are using cracked versions of Honorbuddy.

All three profiles will use the same hotspots & blackspots, 
the only difference is the ID of the timber which will be farmed.

Ensure that you load the profile, according to the level Timber Mill which you have in your Garrison.
Eg:  Do not load Timber Level 3, if you only have a Level 2 Timber Mill.

Please report any issues directly on the Forum thread, always attach a full log file as well as any
location specific coordinates which can be retrieved using the "Developer Tools" in Honorbuddy.
Always click the Refresh button before copying the coordinates, to ensure the correct coordinates are supplied.

Thank you for using this profile.
Team South Africa.
